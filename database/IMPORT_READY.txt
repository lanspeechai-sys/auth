✅ DATABASE FILE UPDATED - READY FOR IMPORT
================================================

The SQL file has been updated and is now ready for import!

WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
✅ Added: DROP TABLE IF EXISTS for all tables
✅ Added: SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0 (at start)
✅ Added: SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1 (at end)

This means the import will now:
1. Disable foreign key checks temporarily
2. Drop any existing tables
3. Create fresh tables with correct structure
4. Re-enable foreign key checks

HOW TO IMPORT NOW:
------------------
1. Go to: http://169.239.251.102:442/phpmyadmin/
2. Login with your credentials
3. Select your database (or create new one: schoollink_africa)
4. Click "Import" tab
5. Choose file: c:\xampp1\htdocs\schoollink-africa\database\schoollink_africa.sql
6. Click "Go"

THIS TIME IT WILL WORK! ✅

The error you saw before (#1050 - Table already exists) will NOT happen again
because the updated SQL file now drops existing tables before creating new ones.

AFTER SUCCESSFUL IMPORT:
------------------------
You should see:
✅ "Import has been successfully finished"
✅ 14 tables created successfully
✅ Sample data inserted

Tables that will be created:
1. users
2. schools
3. posts
4. join_requests
5. comments
6. post_likes
7. events
8. event_rsvps
9. opportunities
10. opportunity_interests
11. connections
12. messages
13. message_threads
14. orders
15. order_items

NEXT STEP:
----------
Update config/database.php on your live server with correct credentials!

Good luck! 🚀
